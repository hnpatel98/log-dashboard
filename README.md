# Log Dashboard - AI-Powered Security Analysis

A modern web application for analyzing log files with AI-powered threat detection and anomaly identification. Built with Flask backend, Next.js frontend, and containerized with Docker.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Google AI Studio API key (see [Configuration](#-configuration) section)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd log-dashboard
   ```

2. **Configure Google AI Integration**
   - Follow the [Google AI Integration Setup](#google-ai-integration-setup) section below
   - Create `.env` file with your API key
   - Optionally encrypt your API key for security

3. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the dashboard**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000
   - Login credentials: `admin` / `admin`

5. **Verify installation**
   - Upload a log file through the web interface
   - Check that AI summaries are generated (requires valid API key)
   - Review threat detection and anomaly analysis results

### Sample Data
The repository includes sample log files for testing:
- `sample-logs.txt` - Basic application logs
- `sample-logs-with-threats.txt` - Logs with security threats

### Stopping the Application
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Troubleshooting

#### **Port Already in Use**
If you get port conflicts:
```bash
# Check what's using the ports
lsof -i :3000
lsof -i :5001

# Stop conflicting services or change ports in docker-compose.yml
```

#### **Docker Not Running**
```bash
# Start Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows)
# Or start Docker service (Linux)
sudo systemctl start docker
```

#### **Container Build Issues**
```bash
# Rebuild containers from scratch
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

#### **Frontend Not Loading**
- Check if backend is running: `curl http://localhost:5001/api/health`
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Check browser console for errors

#### **File Upload Issues**
- Ensure file is `.txt` or `.log` format
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Verify file has readable content

## 🚀 Configuration

### Google AI Integration Setup

**Important**: This application uses Google AI Studio (Gemini) for generating AI-powered log analysis summaries. You must provide your own Google AI API key for this feature to work.

#### **Step 1: Get Your Google AI API Key**
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Navigate to "Get API key" in the left sidebar
4. Create a new API key or use an existing one
5. Copy the API key (starts with `AIza...`)

#### **Step 2: Create Environment File**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project:

```bash
# In the log-dashboard directory
touch .env
```

#### **Step 3: Add Your API Key**
Open the `.env` file and add your Google AI API key:

```env
# Google AI Studio API Key (required for AI summaries)
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaSyYourActualAPIKeyHere

# Encryption key for securing API keys (32 characters)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_encryption_key_here

# Optional: Customize settings
FLASK_DEBUG=True
THREAT_DETECTION_ENABLED=True
ANOMALY_DETECTION_ENABLED=True
```

#### **Step 4: Encrypt Your API Key (Recommended)**
For enhanced security, encrypt your API key:

```bash
cd backend
python encrypt_keys.py
```

This will prompt you to enter your API key and save it encrypted in the `.env` file.

**Note**: If no Google AI API key is provided, the system will fall back to mock AI summaries with basic rule-based recommendations. For full AI-powered analysis, a valid API key is required.

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# AI API Keys (encrypted)
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_key_here

# Encryption key for API keys
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_encryption_key

# Optional: Customize settings
FLASK_DEBUG=True
THREAT_DETECTION_ENABLED=True
ANOMALY_DETECTION_ENABLED=True
```

### Encrypting API Keys
Use the provided utility to securely encrypt your API keys:

```bash
cd backend
python encrypt_keys.py
```

## 🤖 AI-Powered Anomaly Detection

### Approach Overview
The system uses a **multi-layered approach** combining statistical analysis and machine learning to detect anomalies in log files.

### Detection Methods

#### 1. **Feature Extraction**
For each log entry, the system extracts 6 key features:
- **Message Length**: Total character count
- **Special Characters**: Count of non-alphanumeric characters
- **Numbers**: Count of numeric values
- **Uppercase Letters**: Count of capital letters
- **Word Count**: Number of words in the message
- **Average Word Length**: Mean character count per word

#### 2. **Statistical Analysis**
- Calculates mean, standard deviation, min, and max for each feature
- Uses Z-score analysis to identify statistically significant deviations
- Threshold: Z-score > 2 indicates anomaly

#### 3. **Machine Learning Detection**
- **Algorithm**: Isolation Forest
- **Purpose**: Detects outliers in multi-dimensional feature space
- **Contamination**: 10% (configurable)
- **Advantage**: Works well with high-dimensional data and doesn't require labeled training data

#### 4. **Pattern-Based Detection**
Simultaneously runs traditional pattern matching for known threats:
- SQL Injection patterns
- XSS Attack signatures
- Authentication failures
- Command injection attempts
- File inclusion attacks

### Anomaly Classification

#### **Statistical Anomalies**
- Unusually long/short messages
- Excessive special characters
- Unusual numeric patterns
- Abnormal word counts
- Deviant word lengths

#### **Behavioral Anomalies**
- High error rates
- Consecutive error bursts
- Unusual timing patterns
- Suspicious access patterns

### Confidence Scoring
- **Pattern-based threats**: 0.5-1.0 based on severity and log level
- **Anomalies**: 0.7 base confidence with additional scoring based on feature deviations
- **Risk assessment**: 0-100 scale combining confidence, severity, and contextual factors

### Example Anomaly Detection

```
Normal Log: "User login successful"
Features: length=20, special_chars=0, numbers=0, uppercase=1, words=2, avg_word_length=10

Anomalous Log: "User login successful with detailed authentication process including multi-factor verification and session management for enhanced security compliance"
Features: length=150, special_chars=0, numbers=0, uppercase=1, words=15, avg_word_length=10

Detection: Z-score for message length = 10.6 (highly anomalous)
Explanation: "Unusually long message (150 chars vs avg 45.2)"
```
